# Remote-video-and-data-streaming-system
This project demonstrates a reliable system for transmitting detection data and live video frames between devices connected to different networks (e.g., using mobile data or Wi-Fi).    The system was developed to handle network instability, real-time data synchronization, and asynchronous frame transmission using Python.
